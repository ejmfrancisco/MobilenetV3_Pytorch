# MobilenetV3_Pytorch
Training classifier model + inference using Pytorch.

1. Create Anaconda environment.
2. Run the 'train.py' for training after setting up dataset location.
3. Test inference

Results may vary when tested in different environment.

I referred this code based on the github implementation: https://github.com/kuan-wang/pytorch-mobilenet-v3
