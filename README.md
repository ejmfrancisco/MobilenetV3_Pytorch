# MobilenetV3_Pytorch
Training a classifier model + inference using Pytorch.

1. Create Anaconda environment. (or any self preference environment)
2. Run the 'train.py' for training after setting up dataset location.
3. Test inference

Results may vary when tested in different environment.

Torch can be installed based on system capabilities: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

I referred this code based on the github implementation: https://github.com/kuan-wang/pytorch-mobilenet-v3
